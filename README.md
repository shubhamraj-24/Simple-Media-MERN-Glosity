Step-By-Step instructions to run the app:-
1. Clone the GitHub Repository
Open your terminal (command prompt) and navigate to the directory where you want to clone the 
repository.

   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-mern-repo.git
   
   Replace your-username with your GitHub username and your-mern-repo with the name of your MERN repository.
3. Navigate to the Project Directory
   
   cd server

2. Navigate to the Project Directory
   
   cd your-mern-repo

4. Set Up Backend (Server)
   Navigate to the server folder:

   cd server

   Initialize the backend dependencies:

   npm install

6. Connect Frontend to Backend
   Update the necessary configurations in the frontend code (e.g., API URLs) to connect to the backend.

7. Run Backend and Frontend
   In the server folder, start the backend server:

   npm start

   In the client folder, start the frontend:
